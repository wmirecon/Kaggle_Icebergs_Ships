# Kaggle Competition: Distinguishing Icebergs from Ships in Satellite Images

This is my repository for my second capstone project for the Springboard Data Science Career Track course. The project will use varying ML techniques to
distinguish icebergs from ships in satellite imagery. The images are coded into two series of radar return data.

Rules for the competition require that source code not be shared publicly, except for through the Kaggle competition page.
To confirm to this rule, until the competition ends, in January, 2018, any source code, which will be contained in Jupyter notebooks, will be withheld from this repository.
Source code notebooks will be made available in this repository once the competition ends. Until that time, if you need to see the notebooks for any reason (such as assessing my skills for possible employment or review
for project assessment by Springboard personnel), then please contact me directly. I will maintain separate versions shareable for this purpose that I will provide to you directly.

This readme will be updated as the project proceeds.
