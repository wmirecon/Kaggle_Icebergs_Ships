# Kaggle Competition: Distinguishing Icebergs from Ships in Satellite Images

This is my repository for my second capstone project for the Springboard Data Science Career Track course. The project will use varying ML techniques to
distinguish icebergs from ships in satellite imagery. The images are coded into two series of radar return data.
